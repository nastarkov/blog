## What have I been doing all last week

1. Last week Yulechka went to a Georgian restaurant. We liked it very much, but the soup was spicy
2. I also helped my friend buy an iPhone because he lives in another city. I bought it and sent it to Orenburg
3. I also had the last lesson with my student this school year. I hope he did well on his exam

I wish you all productive days!
