## What have I been doing all last week

1. Last week I studied at the university, did laboratory work, each for 4 hours + individual project 3 hours
2. I also went to barbecue, rested in nature
3. At the same time, I did not forget about my work

What can be said in general about the previous week, I lived it the same way as everyone else, only instead of relaxing in nature I was doing something else.
