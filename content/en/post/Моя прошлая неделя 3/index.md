## What have I been doing all last week

1. Last week, I finally smelled summer, coming holidays and having a great time.
2. All last week I was preparing for tests, I walked a little and met with friends, I was in a Georgian restaurant
3. Work is the most important condition for my existence in another city. So I worked hard for food and taxis

What can be said in general about the previous week, I lived it the same way as everyone else, but there were also novelties in the form of dishes from a Georgian restaurant
